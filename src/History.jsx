                <h2>Before Soulvers3 came out as a music artist for the gospel:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Soulvers3 was a worldly YouTuber with a desire for fame and fortune. (The channel today no longer exists).</li>
                    <li>Soulvers3 had a lot of awful friendships and relationships that lead him down a path of needing God in their life.</li>
                    <li>Soulvers3 knew of the Gospel for most of their life but never took it serious as he does today.</li>
                </ul>
